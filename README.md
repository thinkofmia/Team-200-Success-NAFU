## Why use NAFU?
### 1. No ads
Hence the name NAFU. No Ads For yoU.
A lot of apps have constantly bombard users with messages from sponsors etc. Our platform guarantees an ad-free experience, allowing you to get your content without going through tons of unwanted messages.

### 2. Web-Scraped and Centralised Content
Our app is a central platform that gathers information from all available sources. This includes scraping events from Telegram, Eventbrite etc. So you donâ€™t have to go all over the place to look for what you want. It is all in one place.

### 3. Feed is based on User Preferences
Based on your preferences and filter, we help to easily narrow down your searches and sort them accordingly. Making it even faster to find your event of choice.

### 4. User-friendly
It is a simple yet robust app with easy-to-use functions. The events are regularly updated and pulled from the scraper.

### 5. Feasible and Scalable
Our app can be easily scaled by increasing the number of event sources which we can scrape from. Applying new APIs for each source does not change the base code of the app but instead extends to it like a plugin.

This app is also feasible in the long run in the post-covid era as people are looking forward to events especially for mingling with the rest of society. Having such apps would significantly increase the efficiency in which they can find an event they are interested in.
